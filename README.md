# Creating Artistic Visual Representations of a Circus Performer’s Acrobatic Movement
This repository serves as the collection of all software files for this research project.

## Abstract
This project aims to construct a motion tracking system that will track the acceleration of the human body. The purpose of this system is to analyze how motion data can be used to visualize new perspectives of a circus performer’s movement. To create a large range of motion for the performer, the tracking system will be sewn into an acrobatic shoe and the data will be transmitted wirelessly to a laptop that will visualize the data in an artistic manner.
